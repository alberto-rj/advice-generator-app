## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM, Fetch API)

### What I learned

- **Values `open-quote` and `close-quote` of the CSS property `content`**
  - `open-quote` - Sets the content to be an opening quote.
  - `close-quote` - Sets the content to be a closing quote.

  - **HTML**

    ```html
    <p>Hello World</p>
    ```

  - **CSS**
  
    ```css
    p::before {
      content: open-quote;
    }

    p::after {
      content: close-quote;
    }
    ```

  - **Result - after page load**

    *"Hello World"*

- **HTML DOM Element `cloneNode()` method:**
  - The `cloneNode()` method creates a copy of a node, and returns the clone.
  - The `cloneNode()` method clones all attributes and their values.
  - Set the deep parameter to `true` if you also want to clone descendants (children).
  
  - **HTML**

    ```html
    <div id="hello">
      <p>Hello</p>
    </div>
    <div id="world">
      <p>World</p>
    </div>
    ```

  - **JavaScript**
  
    ```js
    const hello = document.getElementById('hello');
    const world = document.getElementById('world');
    console.log(hello.cloneNode(false)); // <div id="hello"></div>
    console.log(world.cloneNode(true)); // <div id="world"><p>World</p></div>
    ```

- **`<template>` HTML tag** - Used as a container to hold some HTML content hidden from the user when the page loads.

  - **HTML**

    ```html
    <button onclick="showContent()">Show hidden content</button>
    <template id="myTemplate">
      <p>This paragraph is hidden from the user by default</p>
    <template>
    ```

  - **JavaScript**
  
    ```js
    function showContent() {
      var template = document.getElementById("myTemplate");
      var p = template.content.cloneNode(true);
      document.body.appendChild(p);
    }
    ```

  - **Result - after calling the `showContent()` method**

    ```html
    <button onclick="showContent()">Show hidden content</button>
    <template id="myTemplate">
      <p>This paragraph is hidden from the user by default</p>
    <template>
    <p>This paragraph is hidden from the user by default</p>
    ```
